a set of tools available for linux, English and Polish versions available.
some of them can not work on some linux distros, for example updater will dont work on kalilinux.
go ahead and add permisions to the files required to make them executable, chmod +x updater.sh aktualizacje.sh dodawanie.sh addition.sh
you see files with weird names? they are just Polish(original) files.
you want translate?
just add the translation to pull request, I'll merge it.
